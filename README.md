# fs2020-livery-manager
Livery manager for Microsoft's 2020 flight simulator.
Created to lessen the workload for adding liveries to Clink123's megapack

# Important!
This program doesn't _magically_ add the texture files to the megapack, this you still have to do yourself.
Next to this, because of how the livery system currently works, it is very important that you make sure you put in the right values after running the script.
If you run into problems please look below in the known issues list to see if your problem is there.
